# ðŸ§© Course Components

Sarah Classic Coding Fundamentals applies a flipped classroom model that consists of 2 components: **self-learning** and **live classes**.

## Self-Learning

The goal of self-learning is for students to learn concepts **before** class, such that class time can be spent discussing those concepts. **Self-learning is mandatory**, and will consist of videos and exercises listed under the Pre-Class header.

## **Live Classes**

The objective of live classes is to enable students to gain a better understanding of the concepts learnt during self-learning through instructor facilitated discussion. 

Live classes will be held online over Zoom. 

Generally, each session is divided into 2 parts:
- Q&A
- Pair Programming

### Q&A

Students are encouraged to post their questions in the designated student forums before coming into class to optimise the time allocated for each session. Please keep your questions on the Unit topic that is featured for the week. Please refer to the [Course Schedule](../schedule/README.md) for Unit titles.

### Pair Programming
Pair programming is a common software engineering activity that involves 2 engineers working on the same computer, on the same problem together. Typically, 1 engineer acts as the "driver", controlling the keyboard and writing the code. The other engineer acts as the "navigator", helping to guide the overall strategy and look up documentation (on a separate computer).

Pair programming is commonly used for the following purposes:

- To share knowledge across teams or between juniors and seniors, where the navigator is typically more knowledgeable about that part of the system than the driver.

- To ensure an important piece of software gets done correctly. Sometimes, for difficult software engineering problems with large future repercussions, it is more worth it to spend 2 engineers' time to get it right, than to spend 1 engineer's time and risk getting it wrong.

During Sarah Classic, we will apply pair programming techniqies to solidify our understanding of concepts by coding and explaining in front of each other. 


## Exercise, Project Strategy

Please read through all sections of exercises and projects before starting. Later parts of exercises and projects may require different code architecture than earlier parts. **Failure to take into consideration all aspects of the project might result in a lengthy refactor.**

### Base, More Comfortable

To accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects may have different sections to differentiate what must be completed to minimally understand concepts, and what are extra exercises or features to help solidify one's understanding.

#### Base

Everything in the Base section must be completed to minimally understand relevant concepts. When short on time, we can complete the Base section then move onto the next exercise or project.

#### More Comfortable

The More Comfortable section is for students that wish to push their boundaries. Students can complete Sarah Classic without touching More Comfortable, but students that complete More Comfortable exercises will gain more experience and may be more valuable in the job market.
