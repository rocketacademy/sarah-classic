# 7.1: GitHub Fork and Pull Request

## Introduction

We will learn more features of Git and GitHub to start and submit SWE101 projects. As a reminder, Git is the version control system and GitHub is the code-hosting website built on top of Git. GitHub extends the capabilities of Git by adding visual code browsing, social features, and collaboration features like "forks" and "pull requests". Feel free to use this page as a resource if you need help starting or submitting a project.

## GitHub Fork

"Fork" is the GitHub term for copying a repo from one GitHub account to another. We can fork a repo by clicking the Fork button on a given GitHub repo page. Forking allows us to make changes to a repo and save those changes to our own GitHub account's copy of the repo. Our account's repo is essentially independent from the original, forked repo.

"Fork" is a GitHub concept. Forking is not built-in to the Git version control system.

## Git Push

We will learn 1 new Git command `push` to send local code commits from our computers to GitHub. `push` can also be used as a general command to move code between "remote" repos, but during Coding Basics we will only be using `push` to push code to GitHub.

## GitHub Pull Request

A GitHub "[**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)" \(PR\) is a request to pull changes from 1 repo on GitHub to another. PRs are most commonly used as a code-review mechanism, where developers submit PRs for review before merging the code in those PRs to their company's shared repo. We will use PRs in Coding Basics to submit projects.

When we've pushed our changes to our repo, we'll click the "Pull requests" button to create a new pull request.

## Cheatsheet

Here is the workflow for Coding Basics projects:

1. Go to the project repo page. Click the "Fork" button to copy the repo to your own GitHub account.
2. On your computer in the command line, **clone the repo from your own Github account's copy of the repo.**
3. Once the repo is on your computer, follow the Git workflow and cheatsheet [here](../2-organising-and-managing-code-files/2.2-git.md#cheat-sheet).
4. `git push` your changes to your repo. Refresh the repo page to see your commits on the repo.
5. Create a pull request in GitHub. This connects your work on the repo _in your account_ to the original Rocket Academy repo. Fill in the survey and submit.

## Exercises

### Follow Along

Follow along with the video and create a fork and pull request of the [`github-practice` repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/github-practice). Note there is no survey to complete for the practice repo.
